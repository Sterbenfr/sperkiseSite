# Sperkise Association Website

Welcome to the Sperkise Association website repository! I am the developer
responsible for managing the website of the "Club de MinÃ©ralogie et de
PalÃ©ontologie de la MÃ©tropole Nord - Wasquehal" (Mineralogy and Paleontology
Club of the French North Metropolis - Wasquehal).

## About Us

At Sperkise, we are passionate about ðŸ’Ž Mineralogy ðŸ’Ž and ðŸ¦– Paleontology ðŸ¦•.
Our mission is to facilitate communication with individuals who share our
passion through monthly conferences (that should be open to remote participation
via video conference soon) and an annual exposition. We also aim to keep
everyone informed about our latest activities, which include regular outings
organized by our club members to search for minerals and fossils almost every
month in the northern region of France.
